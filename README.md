**CG2111A Robot capable of Blind Maze Navigation in Real-time**
Our team of 4 attached the Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi to be able to navigate a blind maze in real time via serial commmunication between the local computer and the raspberry pi.
The raspberry pi then sends commands to the Arduino Mega, and the OK signal is sent the other way to acknowledge that the packet was sent.
